### for my Neurodiversity Club
**welcome to my find(humanity) characters repository, which is purely for use with the game "find(humanity)"**
remind me to add anything to the readme as needed.
Please duplicate the template folder and edit the duplicate to create your character.
oh also
You can find the original Find(Humanity) at the following link: [Find(Humanity)](https://ghostspark-off.itch.io/find-humanity)
Before you play, please download the rules and the image located in the zip file. 
Feel free to obtain them for free, but if you'd like to give the creator some love, I won't stop ya from giving a gift.
I will not be providing the rules or the image for the character sheet on this public github, for saftey sake.
Though, if we create custom or edit rules, I will add them in the readme.
