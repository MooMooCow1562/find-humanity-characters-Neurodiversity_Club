# *Protocol rules*
Whenever you add a protocol, write it down to your protocols. Whenever you come across a situation where you can execute a protocol, you WILL execute a protocol. This is an automatic feature.

Every time you execute a protocol, you become more proficient in executing it. Every protocol has value 1 when you execute it for the first time, and add 1 to the value each time you execute it, to the maximum of 4.

If your character is programmed to do something, they are able to do it.
